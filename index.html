                <li>The quiz assumes that you know <span>bits of knowledge</span> from every subject that you studied this year (Grade 9).
                </li>
                <li>There are <span>5 questions for 4 selected subjects</span> in this school year, and <span>1 from 5 random subjects</span>, totalling to a number of 30 questions for the entire quiz.
                </li>
                <li>They will consist of <span>identification questions, checkbox questions, multiple choice questions, and more</span>. There are <span>no essays</span> for easy computer checking. Text inputs must be typed in <span>"Capitalize Each Word"</span> form.</li>
                <li>Checkboxes have a really cool property -- you can select <span>NONE of them because they are graded right minus wrong</span>, and some questions are <span>designed to have NO correct answer</span>.
                <li>Your answers <span>save</span>. Do not worry if you disconnect, because your <span>your data will still be there</span> once you reconnect!
                </li>
                <li>You can use the <span>arrows in the left and right sides of the quiz</span> in order to navigate through the quiz (you will see them later). <span>Do not forget to submit each part </span> of the quiz though, or you might get <span>zeroes</span> for that specific part of the quiz.
                </li>
                <li>Have fun, because you will have a very great time (if you did well or mediocre this school year)! </li>
