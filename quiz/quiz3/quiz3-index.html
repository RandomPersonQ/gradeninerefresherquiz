        <div id="q1header">Question 1</div>
        <div id="q1content">
            <p>The first quarter for Physics were pretty easy and introductory, compared to the next quarters that follow after it. We were taught the basics of <span>Newtonian physics</span> -- such as <span>force</span>, <span>motion graphs</span>, and <span>kinematics</span>.
            <p>Find the <span>velocity of a runner just before he stops</span> after running for <span>7.5 seconds</span> for <span>7.5 m/s<sup>2</sup></span>. He started off at <span>3.5 m/s</span>. Round off to the nearest whole number. </p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div id="q2header">Question 2</div>
        <div id="q2content">
            <p>For me, the hardest quarter for Physics is the <span>2nd quarter</span>. I just did not have enough foundation from the previous quarter because kinematics were really hard for me. In fact, this part of the quiz was <span>really hard</span> for me because if there's one thing harder than answering Physics questions, it's making them and at the same time having whole numbers in the end.</p>
            <p>Your future self sends you a <span>cryptic message</span> in the form of a trebuchet which has the code to a secret message for the past. The instruction in the trebuchet tells you to shoot a <span>123.0 g</span> ball <span>70 degrees</span> at <span>49 m/s</span> at the top of a watchtower <span>500 meters above sea level</span>. The <span>maximum height</span> of the ball relative to sea level, in <span>m</span>, is the four digit code that will play a huge part in your, or perhaps the world's future.</p>
            <p>What is the <span>four-digit code</span>? (xyz.a -> x-y-z-a)</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div id="q3header">Question 3</div>
        <div id="q3content">
            <p>Contrary to the second quarter, third quarter has been surprisingly easy. Recall the topics of <span>gravity, gravitation, and Kepler's planetary laws of motion</span>, <span> uniform circular motion</span>, <span>torque</span>, <span>rotational inertia</span>, and <span>center of mass</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Gravity</span> is basically the acceleration you feel when you get near any object, it can be small or large.</p>
            <p><span>UCM</span> is the part of physics that refers to the centripetal acceleration, velocities, normal forces, and etc. of uniformly rotating systems.</p>
            <p><span>Torque</span> is the ability to apply more force by changing the location where the force is applied.</p>
            <p><span>Rotational inertia</span> is the property of spinning objects to resist change in acceleration.</p>
            <p>Okay, so <span>rotational inertia</span>. A conceptual, easy, break question: ignoring <span>air resistance and friction</span>, what reaches the ground faster, a <span>hollow cylinder</span> or a <span>solid cylinder</span>? </p>
            <p>Hint: Remember what I said about checkboxes in the instructions page?</p>

                <input type="checkbox" id="Hollow Cylinder" name="t3q3_answer" value="Hollow Cylinder"  />Hollow Cylinder<br>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div id="q4header">Question 4</div>
        <div id="q4content">
            <p>Another topic from the second quarter is <span>obvious</span>. Haha, get it? <span>Apparent weight</span> differs from the real weight of a person because of <span>another force that also acts in the y-axis</span> that may change the net force of the acceleration of gravity thus affecting the weight of the person.</p>
            <p>How heavy does a human feel when he or she has a mass of <span>57 kilograms</span> in an elevator in Mars <span>going up at 2 m/s<sup>2</sup></span>? Let's say that the gravity in Mars is <span>3.72 m/s<sup>2</sup></span>, and let's say that <span>rounding</span> does not exist on Mars.</p>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div id="q5header">Question 5</div>
        <div id="q5content">
            <p>Fourth quarter physics is all about <span>energies</span>. Potential, kinetic, elastic potential, mechanical, and other energies that make up the <span>conservative forces</span>.</p>
            <p>Let's say your past self <span>sends you back the trebuchet from Question 2</span> and it's all worn out. However, you re-read the instructions and you from the past changed it! "A new code can be revealed by shooting this <span>500-g</span> vintage-looking projectile <span>50 degrees to the horizontal</span> with a throw <span>200.0 m/s</span> fast, all at sea level".</p>
            <p>Apparently the code is the <span>velocity of the ancient projectile before it hits the ground</span>. Find the <span>first four digits</span> of the code. (follow x-y-z-a formatting from Question 2)</p>
