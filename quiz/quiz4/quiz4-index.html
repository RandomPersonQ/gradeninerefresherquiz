        <div id="q1content">
            <p>If I was to compare the first quarter of Mathematics for this grade to something, I would say the first quarter of Math for our entire journey. The topics <span>look so easy</span>, but they are <span>annoyingly difficult to grasp and master</span>. In case you have forgotten, our topics for Math for this quarter were <span>transformations</span>, such as <span>translation</span>, <span>rotation</span>, <span>dilation</span>, and <span>rotation</span>, and properties of different types of functions (<span>odd and even</span>, <span>multiplicities</span>, and etc).</p>
            <p>What is <span>g(x)</span>, the <span>factored form</span> of the function of this polynomial if <span>reflected across the x-axis</span>?</p>
            <p>f(x) = <span>x<sup>5</sup> + 6x<sup>4</sup> + 9x<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup> - 12x</span></p>
            <p>Note: If you find exponents or multiplicities, write them as ^x, where x is the power, and the order of the factors doesn't matter. If a variable is not inside a binomial, enclose in parentheses. Example: (x)(x+3)^2(x+2)(x-3)^4.</p>

        <div id="q2content">
            <p>Second quarter was one of the lighter quarters in my opinion, due to it only consisting of the <span>different types of parent functions there are</span> -- this does not mean that it was easy though, because there were so many of them. Examples of these are the <span>rational</span>, <span>radical</span>, and <span>piecewise</span> functions.</p>
            <p>Before we delve into the difficult questions 3 and 4, a simple <span>exchange</span> between variables will be done. If the value of <span>n</span> is the <span>area of the values two standard deviations within from the mean in a standard normal distribution, divided by ten rounded off to the nearest whole number (sorry)</span>, then what is the <span>the index of the radical on the numerator</span> of the inverse of the function below?</p>

            <p>Third quarter was hard to get the gist of, but once you get it and it clicks, it just feels <span>bliss</span>. We concentrated on the concept of <span>power</span> -- its function forms, and its inverse as well. Topics include <span>exponential and logarithmic functions</span>, and <span>equations</span> involving these concepts as well.</p>
            <p>What is the value of <span>x</span> in the equation below?</p>

            <p>For the last quarter of math, we were taught how to find the different properties of <span>sequences</span> -- the <span>first terms, common differences / ratios, and how we derived these equations to get a much better understanding of these lessons</span>. Before all that, we were taught to distinguish specific types of sequences from another sequence.</p>
